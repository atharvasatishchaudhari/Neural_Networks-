This code contains a self-contained Python script that implements a complete training pipeline for ResNet18 on the 
CIFAR10 dataset using PyTorch. The code is organized into distinct sections including model definition 
(with the BasicBlock architecture configured as [2, 2, 2, 2]), data augmentation utilities (using RandomCrop and Cutout transforms), 
and visualization tools for plotting loss curves, displaying galleries of misclassified images, and generating GradCAM outputs. 
Designed for seamless execution in Google Colab, the script trains the model for 20 epochs, logs performance metrics, and saves 
  the final model checkpoint along with visualizations. This code serves as a comprehensive template for deep learning experiments
  and advanced training policies.
